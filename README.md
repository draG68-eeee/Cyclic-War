# The Sacrifice: A 2D Soulslike Adventure

## Overview

**The Sacrifice** is a 2D action-adventure game inspired by Hollow Knight and the Souls series, built using Unity's 2D Game Kit. This project is a learning journey and a passion project by a teen developer with experience in Unity, Unreal Engine, and Roblox. The game emphasizes challenging boss fights, atmospheric storytelling, and meaningful player choices, serving as a prequel to a larger planned saga.

## Story

For many years, the civilizations of **Boria** and **Axteri** have been at war. In a desperate bid for victory, Axteri unleashes ancient beings upon Boria, devastating villages and driving survivors to the capital. You play as **the Sacrifice**, a lone knight who buys time for their village to escape, only to awaken in ruins and face the first of many ancient foes. As the Sacrifice journeys toward Central Boria, they must decide whether to fight for their own survival or to help others, shaping the fate of the world.

### Endings

- **Solo Victory:** Defeat all ancient beings and reach Central Boria.
- **Guidance Path:** Escort a survivor named Ella, ultimately sacrificing yourself for her and the future.

## Features

- **Challenging Boss Fights:** Inspired by Hollow Knight and Souls games, with multi-phase battles and unique mechanics.
- **Minimal Platforming:** Focus is on combat, exploration, and story.
- **Branching Story:** Player choices lead to different endings.
- **Atmospheric Art:** Hand-drawn, bold-outlined sprites and environments.
- **Environmental Storytelling:** Lore revealed through scenery, items, and NPCs.
